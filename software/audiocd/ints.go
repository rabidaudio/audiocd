// relative to the start of the program area, in MSF format:
// minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called frames.
// Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and
// corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data framesâ€”ultimately,
// a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples.
